			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt
					and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a
					tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
				</li>
				<li>
					Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat
					and add butter or oil.
				</li>
				<li>
					Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling,
					pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly
					coat the surface.
				</li>
				<li>
					Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the
					edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle
					your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
				</li>
				<li>
					Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully
					lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for
					another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
				</li>
				<li>
					Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
				</li>
